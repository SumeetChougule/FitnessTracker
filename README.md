# Barbell Exercise Classifier

Welcome to the Barbell Exercise Classifier project! In this Python-based fitness tracker, we're building a machine-learning model to classify various barbell exercises using accelerometer and gyroscope data. This project is designed to provide a comprehensive overview of machine learning in action.

## Project Overview

- **Classification:** The fitness tracker utilizes accelerometer and gyroscope data to classify different barbell exercises accurately.
- **Full Machine Learning Project:** We cover the complete process of building, training, and deploying a machine learning model.
